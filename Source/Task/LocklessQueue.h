/*****************************************************************************
 
 LocklessQueue is a lock free queue that can take any type as a payload.
 Internally it maintains a demand-allocated block of contiguous nodes that
 are used as the nodes of a linked list.  Data pushed into the queue uses a
 copy, and popping data copies that same data out to your variable.
 
 An initial block size is created up front and the size of the block can be customized
 via the constructor.  If the queue runs out of space, it can create new blocks.  This process
 is also lock / wait free, although it has an increassed "push" cost as the new block
 is allocated and initialized. If there is not enough memory to create a new block
 push_back returns false.
 
 N.B. LocklessQueue MUST be either dynamically allocated or stack allocated as a
 local variable.  It cannot be used as a member variable in a class or structure
 due to alignment restrictions. It can fail spectacularly if not aligned correctly.
 
 Typical Usage:
 
 struct MyPayload
 {
    uint32_t someData;
    // etc...
 };
 
 LocklessQueue<MyPayload*> queue;
 
 MyPayload p = new MyPayload;
 p->someData = 16;
 queue.push_back(p);
 
 if (queue.pop_front(p))
 {
    printf("Value: %d\r\n", p->someData);
    delete p;
 }
 
 
 LocklessQueue is based on the the algorithm described in this paper:

 Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue Algorithms

 Maged M. Michael Michael L. Scott
 Department of Computer Science University of Rochester Rochester, NY 14627-0226 fmichael,scottg@cs.rochester.ed

 http://cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf

 In addition to the above algorithm this variant introduces a heap of nodes.  This helps keep the memory
 contiguous and allows for single 64 bit swaps on 64 bit machines (as we don't need to store pointers).

To compile the TAEF project, you must install TAEF.  Here's how:

1) Install Windows Driver Kit (WDK 10), version 1607 at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit.  This will install the TAEF MSI.

2) Now run, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Testing\Runtimes\Test Authoring and Execution Framework x64-x64_en-us.msi" which installs TAEF to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Testing"
